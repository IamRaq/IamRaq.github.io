          <h3>Hello, world! I’m Raq 👋🏾<br /><br /></h3>
          <p>
            I’m a fullstack software engineer with 4+ years of experience
            building secure, scalable, user-centered applications using React,
            TypeScript, Node.js, and Ruby on Rails. I care deeply about clean
            architecture, thoughtful UX, and shipping production-ready products
            that are maintainable long after launch. My background in industrial
            engineering and project-based work helps me bridge the gap between
            engineering, design, and business strategy. Recently, I’ve led
            front-end modernization and re-architecture efforts for enterprise
            financial tools, including migrating legacy systems to modern
            component-driven platforms with automated testing, accessibility,
            and CI/CD best practices.

            <br /><br />
            Outside of business hours, I DJ and collaborate on community-focused
            tech & arts projects. I’m also part of the
            <a href="https://outintech.com/digital-corps/"> Out in Tech </a>
            digital corps, where I help build web products for LGBTQ+ activist
            and nonprofit organizations around the world.

            <br /><br />
            I’m based in Brooklyn, NY and currently exploring full-stack or
            front-end roles on teams that value creativity, purpose-driven work,
            and continuous learning. I’m passionate about using technology to
            create cultural impact and lasting positive change.
